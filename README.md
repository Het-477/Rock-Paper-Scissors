# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This is a simple implementation of our childhood game where you play against the computer. This game project is the part of the Odin Project curriculum where we learn by building and doing, However this project has its flaws in terms of its code quality and its implementation but they will corrected as i learn. 

## Technologies used: 
- HTML
  - Used to link js file to the webpage.

- JavaScript
  - Used to build the main logic behind the game.

Anyways, this was the first time i've built a rock, paper, scissors game and learned a lot form it.
