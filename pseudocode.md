# pseudocode for creating rock, paper, scissors program

- The player will be playing against computer. so we need to make a function which returns string of "rock", "paper", "scissors" randomly. This function will be named `getComputerChoice`, it will use `Math.random` function and array of these three words to return the string present in the array by the index which returned by the `Math.random` function.
- The player will input his/her move with the help of `prompt` which will be case-insensitive while taking inputs such as: "RoCk" "ROCk" or "rocK". if the player enters an incorrect move or has a typo in his move such as: "rack" "rick" then the browser will throw an alert and the player will have to reenter his move. this logic will be written in a `while` loop which only stops when player enters "stop" in the `prompt`. This function will be called `getHumanChoice`.
- The program will keep track of scores of both player and computer, for this two new variables will be created `humanScore` and `computerScore` to keep track of score. **those variables will be initialized with 0**.
- The game will be played round by round. we will create a function named `playRound` which takes `humanChoice` and `computeChoice` as arguments, plays a single round, increments the rounds winner score and logs it onto the console.
